     # block or block state is listed as the background block. The ores retain a mixture
     # of their original properties + those of their background.
     #   The basic syntax is like this: "<ore> <background>." For example, to spawn
     # coal ore inside of sand, you would type "coal_ore sand." Alternatively, you
     # can list out any number of ore blocks inside of a new or existing PropertyGroup
     # below and use its name in the place of "<ore>." Likewise, "<background>" can
     # be replaced with the name of a BlockGroup, as registered below.
     #   Some block and property groups have special names. Those are "all" and
     # "default." Using "all" in the place of either will gather all of the respective
     # entries from below and add them to the list dynamically. Using "default" in the
     # place of either will gather all of the entries that are listed *by default*.
     #   Any block listed in the place of "<ore>" must be registered using a preset
     # located at "./config/osv/ores/." You can add new presets there or modify existing
     # presets to customize their properties. In the future, it will be possible to
     # generate these presets dynamically, but they must be created manually for now.
